Instructions for Setup and Running the Application:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Apply database migrations:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser (admin) to access the Django admin interface:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Access the API endpoints in a web browser or through tools like Postman:

Admin login: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
API endpoints:
Employee List: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/
Employee Detail: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/{id}/
User Registration: http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/
User Login: http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/
Role-Based Access Control Demonstration:
Example:
Admin Role: Can perform all CRUD operations on employees.

Access Employee List: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/
Access Employee Detail: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/{id}/
Add a New Employee: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/ (POST)
Update an Employee: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/{id}/ (PUT)
Delete an Employee: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/{id}/ (DELETE)
Manager Role: Can access Employee List and Add a New Employee.

Access Employee List: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/
Add a New Employee: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/ (POST)
Employee Role: Can only access Employee List.

Access Employee List: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/
Conclusion:
This submission includes the source code, documentation, setup instructions, and a demonstration of role-based access control for the given Django application. The application provides different levels of access to users based on their roles, ensuring proper security measures.
